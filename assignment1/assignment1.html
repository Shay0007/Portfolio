While reading and analyzing Kate Wagner's handwritten essay based on the evolution of the internet in our world. I was very informed on many new topics that I had never even considered beforehand. We all know how much technology and the Internet as a whole have shaped society and ultimately changed the way that we interact and communicate with one another as people in society. The Internet is an extremely useful tool that can be used for so many things including social media, search engines, and contacts. But what we also have found is that these things are great resources, but come with a cost sometimes. That cost can range anywhere from too much screen time, to feuds and debates with one another online and internet addictions as a whole. One specific sub-topic throughout Kate Wagner's essay that piqued my interest is called <em> Breaking the Vaporwaves </em>. This passage ultimately starts by mentioning nostalgia and how the Internet just reuses and recycles the past. There is this specific quote that was included by a man named Frederick Jameson which states "For with the collapse of the high modernist ideology of style what is as unique and unstable as your fingerprints as incomparable as your own body the producers of culture have nowhere to turn, but to the past: the imitation of dead styles, speech through all the masks and voices stored up in the imaginary museum of a now global culture".

	To me, this text sort of goes more in depth on how so many things in our world today, including the Internet and the contents of the Internet such as designs, icons, text, and a lot more are recycled from the past and made to be new again in a sense. I can relate this to trends whether it be clothing, trends, Internet trends, or things that are just now becoming popular again. I feel that especially with technology a lot of the ideas are borrowed and remade so there is still a sense of familiarity and nostalgia linked because the internet as a collective holds so much data and goes back many years. Kate Wagner also states that "Vaporwave, an aesthetic movement dating from the early to mid 2010s is a fascinating study in the futility of critical artistic movements in the face of contemporary capitalism". The word vaporwave throughout this essay is described as a different and unique version of history, a simulacrum; "It was like hitting save instead of save as a version of the 1990s, an overwritten file, a copy, but one for which no original exists".

	Frederick Jameson was able to make an educated guess on what our future with the Internet would look like, and he speaks about letting people in on the contents about the demise of vaporwave: he states "This omnipresence of pastiche is not incompatible with a certain humor, however, nor is it innocent of all passion: it is at the least compatible with addiction, with a whole historically original consumers' appetite for a world transformed into sheer images of itself... It is for such objects that we may reserve Plato's conception of the simulacrum". Throughout this specific subtopic, the popular social media app called Instagram was mentioned quite a bit, It stresses the knowledge of good and bad because you can have an app that is very useful for resources and connecting and communicating with those around you, but then we have to open our eyes to the other side throughout this text is stated as "I barely need to mention the dark side of the platform, the side that leaves people lining up for hours, just to get a selfie, that has changed how we design products, furniture, even buildings, and neighborhoods. All of this is well documented, what is not so obvious is the way that Instagram recycles the originalist statics". While we are able to recognize the pros, it's also important to realize that a lot of the aesthetic touches, images, and icons can be connected back to vaporwave which then ultimately leads people to feel a sense of nostalgia attached to the Internet and apps being used along with it.
