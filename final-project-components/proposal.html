      <header><h1>Final Project Proposal</h1></header>
      <main>
          <p>For this fictitious website, I am going to create a fake line of skin care anti-aging products that claims it is guaranteed to make you look 10 years younger after two weeks of use. For the skin care products, I will be designing the logo and including images as well. I plan to include descriptions of each product and the benefits that each one has. The goal for this website is essentially to have the public “buy” this so-called anti-aging skincare line even though it really does not have the ability to make a person look 10 years younger after two weeks of using the products. I feel like this day in age a lot of people choose certain products based on the popularity of them or the amount of attention that they’re getting either online or in stores. When in reality, there is not one specific product that can work for everybody's skin type because each and every person is different and what may work for one person might not work for another. Personally, I believe that someone should pick a skin care product based on their own skin and whether or not it is sensitive to certain ingredients that are used in creating most of these products. It’s very true that a lot of times a product is advertised as something that is guaranteed to change your skin or guaranteed to get rid of all the wrinkles or blemishes on your face, but in most cases that just isn’t the case. Sometimes people will spend an outrageous amount of money on a product that they’ve never even put on their face just because it’s been advertised or because it’s all over the media. I feel that just because a product is expensive or advertised as the next big thing, it doesn’t mean that it works all the time. </p>
             <p> A lot of people fall victim to this because it’s very easy to get on a bandwagon, but I believe that it’s important to do things for yourself like making sure you’re drinking enough water, making sure to eat a little bit healthier at times, as well as making sure that at the beginning of every day and at the end of every night that you are washing and moisturizing your face. Because sometimes people will buy these expensive products, and assume that their life will  drastically change in two weeks but yet they aren’t doing the other things for themselves, they’re just relying on these falsely advertised products to completely change their lives and their skin. This specific skin care line shows that just because something may look presentable on the outside, and just because something is expensive doesn’t mean that it’s going to contain the right ingredients and nourish your skin. All in all you can’t trust a product that you know nothing about just because the way that it is advertised may seem appealing on the outside. We live in a world today where a good amount of people follow what one person says works, but I feel that we should all be taking the time to make sure it works for us instead of taking someone’s else’s word for it, especially when it comes to something like our bodies and our skin. The fictitious truth here in this website is that “in two weeks after using this product you are guaranteed to look 10 years younger”. And I decided to follow through with this topic because I’ve definitely been through my fair share of skin care bandwagon phases, where I saw a product being advertised on Instagram or TikTok or the Internet, and I automatically assumed that because it worked for other people that it would work for me, but that’s really not how it works.</p>
          <p>I realized that it’s always best to stick with what you know and stick with what works for your skin. I believe that just a simple face wash and a simple moisturizer is really all that you need, as long as you’re also making sure to stay hydrated and nourish your body with good foods that make you feel good and in return also make you look good. The fictitious company that is presenting this information I have yet to provide a name for, but I know that it will be a company that claims to specialize in skin care for all skin types. One specific way that this can be a benevolent untruth is the fact that it can essentially educate people on the importance of reading a label and checking the ingredients before just buying something that looks nice on the outside. It’s so true that you can never judge a book by its cover, so why do the same for picking out skincare products? I believe that so many people have different skin types and I think a lot of people could learn from getting scammed. It sounds bad, but I’ve been there before. I remember when I bought this vitamin C  skincare product online because it claimed to get rid of dark circles and eyebags. I did absolutely no research on this brand. The only reason that I bought it was because I had seen so many people posting about it on TikTok and people claimed that it worked for them, but I tried it for multiple weeks and it never worked. So essentially what I’m getting at is that this can be a benevolent untruth by stressing others to truly take the time to know their own skin and not pick something just because somebody else claims it’s good. You just have to find out for yourself what works and what doesn’t. It’s really so important to read labels and  understand what it is that your skin needs… whether that’s a moisturizer, a cleanser, or you’d be surprised at how many people don’t drink enough water; and not saying hydrated can 100% affect the way that your skin looks. Most importantly the way that you feel on the inside, which is what truly matters the most.</p>
