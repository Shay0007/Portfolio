           <p>I believe that everybody has a right to their own opinion and what one person enjoys another person may not, but in my personal opinion, I believe that pineapples do not belong on pizza. There are a couple things that draw me to this conclusion and the first one being the fact that I am not a huge fan of salty and sweet things mixed together , unless it’s something like chocolate covered pretzels .</p>
           
           <p>I feel that having the sweetness of a pineapple in contrast to the saltiness of pizza can throw off the flavor a little bit for me. The next thing I would say is the texture because a pineapple has a different texture than normal pizza toppings or just the pizza and itself so sometimes that change in texture doesn’t make the pizza that enjoyable. My all-time favorite pizza topping is probably pepperoni just because it’s something that I’ve always had on my pizza and it’s never failed me. </p> 
           
           
           <p>I do believe that it’s important to step out of your comfort zone and try new things every once in a while and for some people they may love pineapples on pizza, but I unfortunately I’m just not one of those people, but I can appreciate the creativity when it comes to Pizza toppings because I know that there is a lot of interesting ones out there. as much as I would love to like pineapples on pizza I unfortunately just can’t push myself to enjoy it.</p>

                <p>According to madeinnewyorkpizza it is stated that “In the culinary world, no food stirs opposing opinions like Hawaiian Pizza. Does pineapple belong on pizza? With ham, bacon, pineapple, cheese, and tomato sauce on the dough as toppings, the Hawaiian Pizza divides people like no other dish.</p>
<p>Some people are incredibly passionate about it, and others loathe it. Based on a survey of approximately 32,000 people worldwide, Mashed investigated what toppings people enjoyed on their pizza.
Pepperoni won with 51% of the votes, but pineapple garnered a surprising number of fans, with about 11% choosing it as their top choice. Pineapple wasn’t far behind sausage (15%) or mushrooms (13%).
    Combining sweet and savory foods is not uncommon. Many people enjoy the sweetness of pineapple and the saltiness of cheese and sauce on pizza. So why are pineapples so controversial on pizza?…</p>
<p>It all began in 1962 when Sam Panopoulos was looking for a way to attract more customers to his pizza joint in Ontario, Canada. Panopoulos first paired sweet pineapple with savory ham as an experiment, but people loved the contrast, and he eventually called it the Hawaiian Pizza.
First, 
scientific evidence 
proves that pineapple belongs on pizza. Pizza is a salty snack that is made better with a little bit of sweetness. With pineapple, the flavor profile gets a much-needed sweetness boost.”</p>
